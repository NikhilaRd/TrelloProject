# TrelloProject

The outcome of this project is to convert a Trello board, with its associated cards and the cards attributes, into a flat text file.
I implemented this project in Java programming language using eclipse.

#Prerequisites

The target machine should have JDK installed in it to run java programs.
Please follow the instructions from the link to install JDK:

After installation of JDK, you need to install org.json.jar zip file and build the path in HTTPURLConnectionExample.java. Use the link to download json jar --> http://www.java2s.com/Code/Jar/o/Downloadorgjsonjar.htm
